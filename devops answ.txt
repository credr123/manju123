 Let say node project - is going to be implemetn - project description is delivered by Project manager

   one Architect. One DevOPs.  - DevOPs guy can would guide them to be follow the 1st step

   

   1. github respository ready to give access to all developers (DevOps guy is the resposibiltiy to give git hub repo to developers ?

   2. how to give env to work on Developers (ec2 instances ) 

   3. how pull request ? git push - it goes to master. how can you block it ? 

   

        we will go for braching protection ?

	4. small peice of code is ready , we have reviewd the code, then we can do #merge, what should be in the next step. Its already in the github repo. what is the next step you will do --- we can clone code , will start the compiling and building jar/ war file from that

	

	5. how will github connected to jenkins ? - webhooks --- 

	

	6. merge is blocked. how will you write unit test ? sonar cube does the analysis 

	

   7. In the branch - set a rule in sonar cube - quality gate - we can define ?

   

   8. Maven - parameters - clean install packege ?

   

   9. how do you writing a jenkinsfile. since it is new project. where will place teh jenkinsfiel - github repositogiry.

   10. how will be the safe for jenkinsfile in github repositogiry - we can create new branch, we can keep in that area only. then the branh will be lock, no body can touch

   

   11. code promoted to some repository - take ex - nexus. we have uploaded. we want to preserve for one week. we have 8 developer, they will do checkin all developers. what can we do now. how do you versioning that. 

   

   12. what is devops ? easist way define from you.

   

   13. now we have a pipeline - the pull reqeust, the guys manageing - they can do ?? artifacts can donwload its dig from Jenkins workspace ?

   

   14. we alwasy keep jenkins workspace should be emply , clean , delete .then do new job.

   

   14. my code is running in my env developer says. but you said it not syncs to build ..how would you solve the problem.

   

      console out - it will give sense. else they are using any differecnt java version , in jenkins may be hacing different java version . like that issues will comes.
